Music and Data together

Began as an attempt to investigate the relationship between lyrical sentiment and audio features in songs, and if there was a possible compounding effect (particularly for songs with depressive lyrics). 

But it has opened the possibility of analyzing much more related to Spotify's music library. Follow along as I begin to add to this repo

Ideas:

* Replicate project to get audio features of different artists and make visualization to compare them and cluster them into different categories based on their music - Top 100 artists?   
* Data visualization of Top 50 Songs of 2010s - look into Plotly and how to make cool data visualizations, and see how the sentiment of lyrics relates to their audio features. 
* Sentiment Analysis - are certain genres of music/artists correlated to depressive lyrics? Look into specific words and word count/sentiment score of specific songs
